                    “The 2018 RAV4 has excellent ride, comfort, and safety technology.
                    I was ambivalent about getting the advanced technology package with
                    parking sensors, surround cameras, front collision avoidance, and lane
                    change detector, but now that I have it, very glad I did. Considered
                    purchasing a Honda CRV or Subaru, but the RAV has better features and comfort.”

                    “Among the numerous compact-SUV choices out there, the 2018 Toyota RAV4 remains a standout.
                    As the vehicle that started the compact-crossover-SUV segment, the RAV4 has consistently
                    been a top seller, right alongside the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Subaru Forester. While
                    not as off-road capable as a Jeep Cherokee, the RAV4 is far more reliable and holds
                    exceptionally strong resale values. Its 4-cylinder engine delivers decent power with good
                    fuel economy, and it has enough ground clearance to tackle most snow and light off-road
                    situations. Better still, every RAV4 comes standard with Toyota’s Safety Sense-P suite of
                    driver assists, and there’s even a hybrid model. Unfortunately, Toyota’s 2018 RAV4 still
                    isn’t compatible with either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.”

                    airbag went off and me and the other passenger were safe and able to walk away alive. Thankful
                    for this car.”
